Nausea, Dizziness, Headache, narcosis, Inhalation of high concentrations of benzene may 
have an initial stimulatory effect on the central nervous system characterized by 
exhilaration, nervous excitation and/or giddiness, depression, drowsiness, or fatigue. The 
victim may experience tightness in the chest, breathlessness, and loss of consciousness. 
Tremors, convulsions, and death due to respiratory paralysis or circulatory collapse can 
occur in a few minutes to several hours following severe exposures. Aspiration of small 
amounts of liquid immediately causes pulmonary edema and hemorrhage of pulmonary 
tissue. Direct skin contact may cause erythema. Repeated or prolonged skin contact may 
result in drying, scaling dermatitis, or development of secondary skin infections. The chief 
target organ is the hematopoietic system. Bleeding from the nose, gums, or mucous 
membranes and the development of purpuric spots, pancytopenia, leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and leukemia may occur as the condition progresses. 
The bone marrow may appear normal, aplastic or hyperplastic, and may not correlate with 
peripheral blood-forming tissues. The onset of effects of prolonged benzene exposure may 
be delayed for many months or years after the actual exposure has ceased., Blood 
disorders 
To the best of our knowledge, the chemical, physical, and toxicological properties have not 
been thoroughly investigated. 

After absorption of large quantities: 

narcosis 
respiratory arrest 
Convulsions 

Possible damages: 

Damage to: 

Liver 
Kidney 
Central nervous system 

Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practice.
